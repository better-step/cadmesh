# STEP-to-HDF5 Conversion and Point Cloud Sampling (steptohdf5 + ABS-HDF5)

## Introduction

This guide explains how to use **steptohdf5** and **ABS-HDF5** together to convert CAD models from STEP/STP files into HDF5 datasets, and then sample those datasets into point clouds. These two tools are designed to work in tandem:

- **steptohdf5** – a converter that turns CAD solids (from *.step or *.stp* files) into **analysis-ready HDF5** files. Each HDF5 file contains the model’s geometry (B-rep surfaces and curves), topology (faces, edges, etc.), and a high-quality triangular mesh for the surfaces. *Currently, steptohdf5 is not available on PyPI or Conda, so it is run via a Docker container.* (A PyPI/Conda release is planned – until then, use Docker as described below.)

- **ABS-HDF5** – a Python/C++ toolkit (available on PyPI) that **reads the HDF5 files produced by steptohdf5** and generates point cloud samples from the geometry. It provides command-line tools to export point clouds to PLY files or Python pickles, and also a Python API for advanced sampling (including fast Poisson-disk downsampling for blue-noise distributions).

**Workflow Overview:** Using these tools, a typical pipeline is:
1. **Convert** a CAD model from STEP to HDF5 (using steptohdf5).  
2. **Sample** the HDF5 model to a point cloud (using ABS-HDF5).  

This README will cover the installation of both tools, then walk through the conversion and sampling steps with examples (including single-file and batch processing), and provide basic API usage for each. Both projects are open-source under the Better Step initiative – see their GitHub repositories for more details:

- **ABS-HDF5**: https://github.com/better-step/abs

## Installation

### steptohdf5 (via Docker)

Since **steptohdf5** is not yet on PyPI or Conda, the easiest way to use it is through its Docker image (which comes with all required dependencies, such as OpenCASCADE). Ensure you have Docker installed, then pull the steptohdf5 image from the registry:

```bash
docker pull itsmechandu/steptohdf5:latest
```


> **Note:** steptohdf5 relies on OpenCASCADE (via `pythonocc-core` 7.4.0) for CAD B-rep processing and uses `meshio` for mesh generation. The Docker image has these pre-installed, so you don't need to install anything else on your host.

### ABS-HDF5 (via pip)

**ABS-HDF5** is distributed on PyPI. Install it into your Python environment (we recommend using a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install abs-hdf5
```

This installs the `abs` Python package along with two CLI tools: `abs-to-ply` and `abs-to-pickle`. No additional system dependencies are required.

> **Tip:** Ensure your `pip` is up-to-date and you’re using Python 3.8 or newer.

## Usage: Conversion and Sampling Pipeline

### 1. Convert STEP → HDF5 using steptohdf5

Run the Docker container with your input and output folders bind-mounted:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/cad_workspace:/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  itsmechandu/steptohdf5:latest \
  steptohdf5 <input.step> -o hdf5 -l logs

docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/cad_workspace:/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  itsmechandu/steptohdf5:latest \
  <input.step> \
  -o output \
  -l logs
```

- `<input.step>`: Path inside `/workspace`, e.g., `cad_files/Model.step`.  
- `-o hdf5`: Output folder for `.hdf5` files (inside `/workspace`).  
- `-l logs`: Folder for log files.

**Single-file example:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/cad_jobs/{cad_files,hdf5,logs}
cp MyModel.step ~/cad_jobs/cad_files/
cd ~/cad_jobs
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  itsmechandu/steptohdf5:latest \
  steptohdf5 cad_files/MyModel.step -o hdf5 -l logs

```

After running, you’ll have:
```
~/cad_jobs/hdf5/MyModel.hdf5
~/cad_jobs/logs/MyModel.log
```

**Batch conversion with a list:**

```bash
ls cad_files/*.step > cad_files/list.txt
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  itsmechandu/steptohdf5:latest \
  steptohdf5 --list cad_files/list.txt -o hdf5 -l logs -j 4

```

### 2. Sample HDF5 → Point Cloud using ABS-HDF5

With ABS-HDF5 installed, use the `abs-to-ply` CLI to generate PLY point clouds from HDF5:

```bash
abs-to-ply hdf5/MyModel.hdf5 samples -n 5000 -j 8
```

- `hdf5/MyModel.hdf5`: Input HDF5 file.  
- `samples`: Output folder for PLY files.  
- `-n 5000`: Points per part after Poisson-disk downsampling.  
- `-j 8`: Parallel workers.

**Batch PLY conversion:**

Convert all HDF5 files in `hdf5/`:

```bash
abs-to-ply hdf5/ samples -n 3000 -j 8
```

This creates `samples/MyModel_part001.ply`, etc., for each part of each model.

**abs-to-pickle example:**

```bash
abs-to-pickle hdf5/ pickles -n 5000 -j 4
```

Generates `.pkl` files containing Python dicts:
```python
{
  'file': 'MyModel.h5',
  'part': 1,
  'points': ndarray(N,3),
  'normals': ndarray(N,3)
}
```

## API Usage

#### steptohdf5 Python API (cadmesh)

```python
from cadmesh import convert_step
from cadmesh.utils.processing import batch_convert_step_files

# Single conversion
h5 = convert_step('cad_files/Model.step', output_dir='hdf5', log_dir='logs')

# Batch conversion
ok, failed = batch_convert_step_files(
    input_list_path='cad_files/list.txt',
    output_dir='hdf5',
    log_dir='logs',
    n_jobs=4
)
```

#### ABS-HDF5 Python API (abs)

```python
import abs

# Read parts from HDF5
parts = abs.read_parts('hdf5/Model.h5')

# Sample points + normals
def face_normals(part, topo, uv):
    return topo.normal(uv) if topo.is_face() else None

points, normals = abs.sample_parts(parts, num_samples=10000, lambda_func=face_normals)

# Poisson-disk downsample to 1000 points
idx = abs.poisson_disk_downsample(points[0], 1000)
sub_points = points[0][idx]
sub_normals = normals[0][idx]
```
